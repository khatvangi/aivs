# HISTORY

## 2026-05-11

**Q:** Apply the AIVS kickoff — extract the 7 adapter files from the design-doc
markdown, install the package, run the full validation sequence, and report the
adapter event-count against `/storage/kiran-stuff/triplet-proof` without yet
touching the existing audit.

**A:** Stood up `/storage/kiran-stuff/aivs/` from `aivs-0.1.0.tar.gz` plus the
two audit example scripts pulled from `kiran-triplet.zip` and `smith audit.zip`.
Extracted and wrote the seven adapter files from
`Designing an AI verification system for scientific research.md`
(lines ~1028–2107): `adapters/base.py` (replaced — adds registry),
`adapters/claude_code.py`, `adapters/codex.py`, `adapters/aider.py`,
`adapters/__init__.py` (replaced — registers concrete adapters),
`tests/test_adapters.py`, `examples/run_claude_code_adapter.py`.

Patched both audit example scripts to write to
`examples/out/` (env-var override `AIVS_OUT_DIR`) instead of the prior
sandbox's `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`.

Validation results:

- `pytest tests/test_meta_schema.py` — 15/15 passed (matches doc).
- `pytest tests/test_adapters.py` — 9/9 passed (doc predicted 8;
  `test_discover_adapters_finds_claude_code` is the ninth). Deprecation
  warnings only — `datetime.utcnow()` should move to
  `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` in `claude_code.py:354`, `aider.py:92`,
  `aider.py:112`. Non-blocking.
- `python -m examples.smith_2026_audit` — integrity OK; counts 12 events /
  13 evidence / 11 decisions / 5 claims / 9 deltas. Matches doc.
- `python -m examples.kiran_triplet_proof_audit` — integrity OK; counts
  15 / 10 / 14 / 7 / 11. Matches doc.
- `python -m examples.run_claude_code_adapter /storage/kiran-stuff/triplet-proof`
  (default verbosity) — **620 events**, time range
  `2026-04-14 15:48:55 UTC → 2026-05-11 18:01:07 UTC`, action distribution:
  tool_use 231, tool_result 231, respond 128, prompt 30.

Notes worth flagging:

- The "10K-50K events" estimate from the prior conversation was wrong by
  ~2 orders of magnitude. Actual is 620 at default verbosity, 791 at
  verbose. Most of the 7.7 MB JSONL is large tool_result payloads
  (Read/Grep output bodies), not many small events.
- The session log time range extends 19 days past the audit baseline
  (2026-04-22), through today. The JSONL captures the `b4b79c9` SVG
  panel render commit (2026-04-23) and unknown subsequent activity that
  has not committed.
- Adapter missed three event types totaling 173 raw lines:
  `permission-mode` (74), `file-history-snapshot` (54), `system` (45).
  Of those, 128 are filtered earlier (no `timestamp` field); 45 surface
  as `unknown_event` only in verbose. None are decision-relevant.
  Candidate for v0.2 adapter refinement.

Stopped at Step 5 of the kickoff. Pending Kiran's call on how to refresh
`examples/kiran_triplet_proof_audit.py` with adapter-derived events.

---

**Q:** Refresh the triplet-proof audit to use adapter-derived events with
per-Decision windowing (±12h) at baseline ≤ 2026-04-22, full re-link
each Decision's evidence_ids, plus the two side items
(`datetime.utcnow()` → `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`, explicit skip-list
for `permission-mode` / `file-history-snapshot` / `system`).

**A:** Done.

Side items:
- `claude_code.py` and `aider.py`: `datetime.utcnow()` →
  `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` (3 sites). Deprecation warnings gone.
- `claude_code.py`: added module-level
  `_SKIP_EVENT_TYPES = frozenset({"queue-operation", "last-prompt",
  "permission-mode", "file-history-snapshot", "system"})`; the early
  type-dispatch now does `if kind in _SKIP_EVENT_TYPES: return`. Verbose
  run dropped from 791 → 746 events (the 45 stray `unknown_event` are
  gone; default verbosity remains 620 — unchanged).
- `NEXT.md` (c.6) added: v0.2 candidates for proper modeling of the
  three skipped types, with `permission-mode` flagged as
  decision-relevant (plan/default/acceptEdits/bypassPermissions toggles
  are meta-decisions about *how* to run Claude Code).
- 24/24 tests pass (15 meta + 9 adapter), no warnings.

Audit refresh (`examples/kiran_triplet_proof_audit.py`):
- New constants: `AUDIT_BASELINE_TS` (Apr 22 23:59:59 UTC),
  `TRIPLET_PROOF_PATH`, `DECISION_WINDOW` (±12h).
- `build_events()` split into `build_bulk_session_events()` (3 coarse)
  and `extract_adapter_events()` (filtered to baseline). The 12 manual
  artifact-prompt Events are dropped — the adapter supplies their
  replacements at fine granularity.
- `build_evidence(adapter_events, bulk_events)` replaces the prior
  10-Evidence structure with **14 per-Decision Evidence objects**
  (13 windowed + 1 bulk for D14). Each windowed Evidence is scoped to
  ±12h around its Decision's documented timestamp, capped at the
  baseline.
- Each Decision's `evidence_ids` re-linked to its own Evidence
  (`E("D1:")` … `E("D14")`). D5 collapsed from a 2-Evidence list to a
  single windowed Evidence covering the whole rebuild + supp-cleanup
  session.
- `build_audit()` rewired; `adapters_used` now lists both `claude_code`
  v0.1.0 and the manual_log fallback.

Refreshed counts: 532 events (3 bulk + 529 adapter ≤ baseline),
14 evidence, 14 decisions, 7 claims, 11 schema deltas. Integrity OK.

Per-Decision window populations (sanity check):

| Decision(s)               | Timestamp           | Events in window |
|---------------------------|---------------------|-----------------:|
| D1, D11                   | 2026-04-14 12:00    | 171              |
| D5, D6, D7, D12, D13      | 2026-04-21 09:00    | 63               |
| D2, D3                    | 2026-04-21 14:00    | 208              |
| D8                        | 2026-04-21 19:00    | 235              |
| D9                        | 2026-04-22 12:00    | 150              |
| D4, D10                   | 2026-04-22 17:00    | 123              |
| D14 (bulk)                | —                   | 3                |

Decisions sharing a timestamp share an identical event set. Accepted
trade-off for v0.1; per-Decision unique timestamp inference (anchor
each Decision to its specific event signature in the JSONL) is a
v0.2 refinement.

Three submission TODOs on triplet-proof (intro rewrite, Methods <0.5
prose, Fig 1c ‖Δf‖ prose) are still open — those are manuscript work,
to be handled in a separate session, not in this audit pass.

---

**Q:** Confirm the two flagged v0.1 limitations are correctly framed,
record them in `NEXT.md` as section (c.7) — not (c.6), so they don't
get conflated with the unclassified-event-types work — and stop. Next
session is the three manuscript TODOs.

**A:** Recorded both in `NEXT.md` (c.7). Two sub-items:

1. `Decision.evidence_fingerprint: Optional[list[str]]` — meta-schema
   addition. Optional field, so existing audits keep validating; bumps
   `META_SCHEMA_VERSION`. Audit Assembler narrows the windowed event
   stream by `target`/`content` containment over the fingerprint
   patterns. Four worked examples (D6, D7, D12, D13) included in the
   NEXT.md entry, drawn from strings already present in the existing
   Decision descriptions — so the v0.2 implementation is half-done in
   practice; just lift strings from prose into the structured field.
2. `SchemaDelta.raw_evidence_ids` populated per-delta — example-script
   fix, not a schema change. Current behavior (every delta references
   the full evidence list) is semantically wrong; intended semantics
   ("evidence supporting *this specific* delta") is already correct
   in the meta-schema. Per audit, build a `delta_evidence_map:
   dict[str, list[str]]` and pass per-delta IDs.

These two sit at different abstraction layers despite the surface
similarity. Bundle them into a single v0.2 pass after the triplet-proof
manuscript ships.

Next session: close the three manuscript TODOs (intro rewrite using
`literature_comparison.md` framing; Methods `<0.5` prose using
`rebuild_notes.md` draft wording; Fig 1c `‖Δf‖` prose — author's call
between Ala-neighborhood values 0 / 3.5-4.9 and a real radical pair
G-P @ 6.23). Push to origin/main, re-run
`kiran_triplet_proof_audit.py` — the three pending UNVERIFIED
decisions should flip to VERIFIED_INDEPENDENTLY; that commit becomes
the new submission-ready baseline; submit JME.

---

**Q:** The framework defaulted to surveillance-grade capture, which is
wrong. Implement the constitutional fix: minimum-capture-for-purpose
default. Verbatim content private by default; authors opt-in per
Decision. Bump v0.2.0. Tasks 1–7 as specified.

**A:** v0.2.0 shipped. Single-commit landing.

Meta-schema (`src/aivs/meta_schema/core.py`):
- `META_SCHEMA_VERSION` → `0.2.0`.
- `Event.content` is now `Optional[str]`; new `Event.content_hash:
  Optional[str]`. `@model_validator(mode="after")` auto-fills the
  sha256 of content when content is set and hash is not. Never
  overwrites a pre-set hash, so redact-mode events round-trip cleanly
  and structural-empty events (neither field set) are valid.
- `Decision.publish_level: Literal["summary", "verbatim"] = "summary"`.
- `AuditArtifact.to_published()`: returns a copy where every Event
  NOT in a verbatim-Decision's evidence chain has `content` stripped;
  content_hash preserved; author-written description/text/notes
  fields untouched.

Adapters: `ClaudeCodeAdapter` v0.2.0 and `AiderAdapter` v0.2.0 now
take `redact: bool = True`. Default behaviour is hash-only emission.
A `_make_event()` helper centralises the redact branch. Module-level
`_hash_content()` in `claude_code.py`, reused by `aider`.

Audit examples:
- Smith 2026: D3, D5, D9 marked `publish_level="verbatim"`. Verbatim
  chain = 7 events out of 12 (verified by walking
  `decision.evidence_ids → evidence.event_ids`).
- triplet-proof: 0/14 verbatim. Adapter rerun with default redact=True;
  529 adapter events arrived with content=None; the 3 author-written
  bulk-session Event contents are stripped at publish time.
- Both `main()` functions now write `<name>_audit.json` (internal) and
  `<name>_audit_published.json` (via `.to_published()`).

Verification (live numbers):
- Smith: internal 39,421 bytes; published 38,627 bytes; delta 794.
  7/12 events have content in published (= verbatim chain exactly).
- triplet-proof: internal 559,417 bytes; published 558,759 bytes;
  delta 658. **0/532 events have content in published.**

Docs:
- `CLAUDE.md`: new "Constitutional principle" section above
  "Strategic decisions"; strategic decision 1 reframed as
  "Reproducibility verification, not workflow surveillance."
- `README.md`: "Privacy posture (v0.2)" section added.
- `CHANGELOG.md` created with v0.2.0 and v0.1.0 entries.
- `NEXT.md` (c.8): records that v0.2.0 went to privacy; (c.7)
  evidence_fingerprint + per-delta_evidence_ids are now v0.3
  candidates, still correctly framed, only the prioritisation
  changed.
- `schema/audit_artifact-0.2.0.json` regenerated from the new
  pydantic model. v0.1.0 schema file kept for historical reference.

Tests: 36 pass (was 24). 7 new in `TestPrivacyPosture` (hash
autocomputation, redacted form, structural-empty form, default
publish_level, verbatim vs summary `to_published`, author-field
preservation, no-verbatim-strips-everything, version constant);
4 new in test_adapters (redact True/False × claude_code/aider).

Adapter version bump (0.1.0 → 0.2.0) on both implementations
reflects the changed default behaviour — adapters of the same name
but different version can be told apart in `AdapterUsage` entries
when re-running an old audit.

Single commit, v0.2.0.
